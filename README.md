This fork of Balanced Annihilation focuses on improving DAI (the AI for bots)
for the gameplay that we like to play.

Humans are all allies against a few bots. Bots receive huge resource bonuses.
With that much resource bonus it should not be possible to rush and beat them
with T1 units. So the game transforms into a kind of tower defense, where
humans build strong stationary defense lines to defend ourself until humans
reach a sufficent economy to launch a massive attack. 

Humans are smarter than AI, so if we manage to defend ourselves long enough, we
should win. The default DAI was too easy to beat this way, because it was not
optimized for this kind of gameplay, it couldn't use its resources efficiently,
couldn't use its units efficiently, and so on.

The purpose of this fork is to teach DAI how to fight against this kind of
defense lines, and to make the gameplay more challanging to us.
