- T2 energy production is mostly based on a predefined exponential growth.
    - This does not take resource bonuses or the resources of the specific map
      into account. Its economy could be much better if it could take energy
      demand into account too.

- Build more energy shields

- If there are enough resources, throttle down T2 units in favor of T3 units.

- Bombers should choose their targets to do the most damage.
    - Consider Fusion reactors' and moho geothermal plants' blast radius
    - Focus on destroying energy shields (to weaken stationary defense lines)
    - Focus on anti nukes, nukes
    - Do not focus on factories, they aren't that important
